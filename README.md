# opencv-haar-classifier
Use this file to detect the eye region in cows. This classifier was generated from the images contained in the "n" and "p" folders. Its result is limited to the scope within which these images are embedded.

The software used to create/improve the classifiers, as well as a tutorial on its usage, is available at: https://amin-ahmadi.com/cascade-trainer-gui/
